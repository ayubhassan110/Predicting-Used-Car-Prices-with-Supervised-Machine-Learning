# Predicting-Used-Car-Prices-with-Supervised-Machine-Learning
The primary objective of this project is to develop a supervised machine learning model capable of accurately predicting the market prices of old or used cars based on various features such as make, model, year of manufacture, mileage, fuel type, transmission, and other relevant attributes. By leveraging historical data and training predictive algorithms, the goal is to provide a reliable, data-driven solution for car buyers, sellers, and dealerships to assess the fair market value of old vehicles, enhance pricing transparency, and support informed decision-making in the used car market.
